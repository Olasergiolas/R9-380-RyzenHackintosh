# R9-380-RyzenHackintosh

These are my OC files to boot a Catalina 10.15 Hackintosh using a Ryzen 5 3600 and a Sapphire r9 380. Everything seems to be working fine except iServices. In order to make those work refer to the link below. IOUSBHIDDriverDescriptorOverride.kext is needed in order to get working some TKL keyboards that do not work with mac os out of the box.

Complete build:</br>
Ryzen 6 3600</br>
MSI B450 A-PRO MAX (Realtek 8111H)</br>
SAPPHIRE R9 380</br>


This was achieved thanks to the people at https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/
